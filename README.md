## Description
Spontaneous - Random quotes is a free iOS app that generates random quotes. It values ease-of-use just as much as the users' privacy, so there are no ads or trackers to disrupt their experience. The app currently includes more than 75000 quotes, which you can only discover randomly. Once you find a quote that you like, you can save it and display it on your home screen inside a widget. The purpose of the app is, to spontaneously discover new quotes. That works with complete randomness and not by searching for them. 

This app is a randomizer of paraphrases. You could also call it a random generator paraphrase tool because it's completely arbitrary. The app also provides widget quotes for the home screen.
